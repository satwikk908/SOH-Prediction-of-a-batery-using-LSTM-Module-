# SOH-Prediction-of-a-batery-using-LSTM-Module-
LSTM for Battery State of Health (SoH) monitoring. This project predicts voltage time-series using 5 battery features (V, I, T, Cap, WhAccu) from 25 csv data files. The two-layer Keras model  achieved an RMSE=0.0105, providing a core component for RUL estimation.
